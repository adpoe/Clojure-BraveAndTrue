; creating the board
; need a data structure that makes it easy to:
; - print
; - check whether move was valid
; - perform a move
; - check whether game is over

; decision -->
; represent board using a MAP with numerical keys corresponding to each board position, and values containing information about that position's connections
; map will also contain a :rows key, storing the total number of rows

; here's the structure itself
{1  {:pegged true, :connections {6 3, 4 2}},
 2  {:pegged true, :connections {9 5, 7 4}},
 3  {:pegged true, :connections {10 6, 8 5}},
 4  {:pegged true, :connections {13 8, 11 7, 6 5, 1 2}},
 5  {:pegged true, :connections {14 9, 12 8}},
 6  {:pegged true, :connections {15 10, 13 9, 4 5, 1 3}},
 7  {:pegged true, :connections {9 8, 2 4}},
 8  {:pegged true, :connections {10 9, 3 5}},
 9  {:pegged true, :connections {7 8, 2 5}},
 10 {:pegged true, :connections {8 9, 3 6}},
 11 {:pegged true, :connections {13 12, 4 7}},
 12 {:pegged true, :connections {14 13, 5 8}},
 13 {:pegged true, :connections {15 14, 11 12, 6 9, 4 8}},
 14 {:pegged true, :connections {12 13, 5 9}},
